Usage HTML Analysis

  Definitions and use-cases for the <<{{{./html-mojo.html}${project.artifactId}:html}}>> goal.

* The {{{./html-mojo.html}clashinspector:html}} goal

  This goal generates and opens a local HTML site for dynamic analysis of dependencies and dependency version clashes.

  The main features are the {{{dependency tree}<dependency tree>}} and the {{{clash-list}<clash-list>}}.
  Using {{{settings & properties}<settings & properties>}} you can define what dependencies you want to analyze.
  The {{{search dependencies}<search dependencies>}} feature enables a comfortable way to search and navigate through dependencies in the tree.

** dependency tree

  The dependency tree shows the dependencies of your project.

  Imagine you run this goal on a project <<<testproject.groupId:testproject-artifactId:1.0>>>. This project and its dependencies
  refer to several versions of <<<com.google.guava:guava>>>.

  In this case this project will be displayed in the top bar as follows:

[images/rootDep.png] root project visualization in the top bar in html-goal

  \
  Afterwards its dependencies will be represented as follows.

*** Default Dependency Representation

 [[1]] The first line shows the <groupId> of the dependency, here <<<com.google.guava>>>

 [[2]] The second line shows the <artifactId> of the dependency, here <<<guava>>>

 [[3]] The third line shows

       [[a]] the <version> of the dependency, here <<<13.0.1>>>

       [[b]] the <scope> of the dependency, which could be

             * <compile> represented by a <<<(c)>>>

             * <test> represented by a <<<(t)>>>

             * <runtime> represented by a <<<(r)>>>

             * <provided> represented by a <<<(p)>>> or

             * <system> represented by a <<<(s)>>>

       [[c]] an <<<(o)>>> if the dependency is <optional>, here it is not optional

       [[d]] an <<<(u)>>> if this dependency is <used by Maven> regarding to the {{{./version_clash.html}nearest definiton}}, here it is the used version

 [[4]] On mouseover you have the opportunity to get {{{Detailed Dependency Representation}details}} of this dependency and to search this dependency on {{{http://www.maven.org}maven-central}} in a new tab, here this link would be {{{http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.google.guava|guava|13.0.1|jar}http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.google.guava|guava|13.0.1|jar}}.

*** Detailed Dependency Representation

[images/depDetailed.png] detailed dependency visualization in html-goal\

 [[1]] Shows the <used version> of this project <<(groupId:artifactId)>>, here <<<com.google.guava:guava>>>. On click highlights and jumps to that <used version> in the tree. Here this dependency will be highlighted, because it is the used one.

 [[2]] Shows the <highest version> of this project. Higher versions lead to {{{./version_clash.html}CRITICAL version clashes}}. On click highlights all dependencies in the tree with the <highest version>. In this case the highest version of <<<com.google.guava:guava>>> is <<<14.0.1>>>.

 [[3]] Shows the <lowest version> of this project. Lower versions lead to {{{./version_clash.html}UNSAFE version clashes}}. On click highlights all dependencies in the tree with the <lowest version>. In this case the lowest version of <<<com.google.guava:guava>>> is <<<12.0>>>.

*** Dependency Tree Structure

	In the last chapters we talked about how dependencies look like.
  Now we will explain how they are structured as a tree.
	The following picture shows the tree for our already mentioned project <<<testproject.groupId:testproject-artifactId:1.0>>>.

	Dependencies are linked via arrows. There are four kind of arrows which will be explained as follows:

[images/arrowGray.png] gray navigation arrow

	1212

[images/arrowYellow.png] yellow navigation arrow

	/2323

[images/arrowRed.png] red navigation arrow

  \2323
