  The ClashInspector Plugin provides the ability to analyze the dependencies, especially dependency version clashes of a project.

* Goals Overview

  The ClashInspector Plugin has following goals:

  * <<{{{./list-mojo.html}deps:list}} >> displays the dependencies with version clashes and a summary of the clashes.

  * <<{{{./tree-mojo.html}deps:tree}} >> displays the dependency tree for this project. The tree also shows version clashes.

* Version Clash

  Dependency version clashes can lead to unpredictable (critical) software problems during development and after deployment.
  That's why it is so important to recognize version clashes early and to fix them, before they make trouble. Read more about how we define
  Maven dependency version clashes on the {{{./version_clash.html}version clash}} page.

  General instructions on how to use the ClashInspector Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage}} page.
